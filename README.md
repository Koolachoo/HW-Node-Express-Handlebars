## Usage

* The left most card intakes the names of burgers and stores them in the database.
* The middle card displays the names of the stored burgers, and generates a button next to each one. In the database, these burgers are set to "False" when it comes to have been eaten.
* Clicking the "It's Devour Hour" button sets the burger to "True" when eaten, and sends all eaten burgers to the third card, that represents all eaten burgers.
